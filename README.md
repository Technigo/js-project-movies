The Movie App is an app listing movies built with React that lets users browse popular films and discover new releases. It uses React Router for seamless navigation between pages and styled-components for custom styling. Users can click on any movie to view more details, including the release date, synopsis and additional information. Loading states are handled smoothly to enhance the user experience while data is being fetched.
