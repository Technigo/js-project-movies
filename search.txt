OK, let's get search to work now. What I want to happen: 

1. The user searches in a search bar
2. When hitting enter, ther's a call to the api search endpoint
3. The results that are returned with the api should be displayed like the movies on frontpage
4. IF there are no results, the user should see that visibly on the screen


I'm not picky on how this all is achieved, but I want the UX to be intuitive.
