# Movies App ðŸŽ¬

This is a multi-page movie application where users can browse popular movies and view detailed information. It's built with React and uses the [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch real-time movie data. This project focuses on using React Router, dynamic routes, and building responsive UI components.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Popular Movies List:** Shows a grid of trending movies fetched from TMDB.
- **Movie Details Page:** Click a movie to view poster, overview, rating, release year and more.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Each movie has its own route using `react-router-dom`.
- **Not Found Page:** Custom 404 for invalid movie IDs or broken links.
- **Loading Spinner:** Smooth loading indicators while fetching data.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Seamless switch between dark and light themes.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for screens from 320px to full desktop.
- **Accessibility Considerations:** Semantic HTML, contrast checks, and Lighthouse score above 95.
