🎬 React Movie App
      
As part of a collaborative project, we teamed up to create a multi-page React application that interacts with themoviedb.org's API.
🚀 What We Built:
[] A movie listing page that fetches and displays data from themoviedb.org
[] Clickable movie items that navigate to a dedicated movie detail page
[] A user-friendly interface styled to reflect and build upon the example design we were provided

🔍 Our Approach:
We chose to fetch and display popular movies, using one of the many available endpoints from the API.
We focused on:

[] Clean and responsive UI design
[] Clear user navigation using React Router
[] Robust asynchronous data fetching with async/await, along with proper error handling

🛠 Tech Stack:
[] React (with hooks and functional components)
[] React Router for multi-page routing
[] TheMovieDB API for real-world movie data
[] Custom CSS / Styled components for layout and design

This project was a great opportunity to explore API integration, manage application state, and build out multiple pages in a modern React workflow.
